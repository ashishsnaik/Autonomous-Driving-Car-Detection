# **Autonomous Driving - Car Detection** 
---
Overview
---

This project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) Algorithm for Object Detection and uses it to detect cars in a video taken by a front-facing camera mounted on a vehicle. 

The code and implementation details can be found in this [Jypyter Notebook](./Autonomous_driving_application-Car_detection_v1.ipynb).
